# AirDraw
AirDraw lets users write or draw in the air using their index finger, with real-time camera-based gesture tracking. The tool captures your finger's movement and creates a visible painting or drawing on-screen, enabling intuitive, touchless interaction for creativity, presentations, or fun demonstrations.
